## Homework

### hw1

Introduction to databases in this homework.

### hw2

In this homework basic relation algebra are used.

### hw3

Uses of SQL sentences to make selections. Very trivial and time-consuming!!! :angry:

### hw4

Still some SQL usage in this homework.

### hw5

Write a trigger and a function in SQL.

### hw6

In this homework basic usage of **E-R Diagram** are used. Due to this trivial job, I have to write it by hand, so no file are included in this folder.

### hw7

In this homework you are required to make a lot of exercises about the **Function Dependency**, **Dependency Preserving** and **BCNF**. Very trivial! And the concept of **BCNF**, **3NF** is very complicated in the book. You need to search some references to better handle it.

### hw8

In this homework you are asked for some easy questions about disks and memory about database.

* Contents range: Chapter 12 && Chapter 13

### hw9

In this homework you are asked for some questions about **index**, mainly for *B_Plus_Tree*.

* Contents range: Chapter 14

### HW10

No homework 10.

### HW11

Homework 11 is about **Recovery System**. After you learn how recovery system in DBMS you will quickly figure it out.

* Contents range: Chapter 19

### HW 12

This homework is about **Query Processing**.

* Contents range: Chapter 15

### HW 13

This homework is about **Query Optimazation**.

* Contents range: Chapter 16

## Labs

### Lab1

First introduced to DBMS. In this course we use *MySQL Server* as the tool. So the first lab is about how to build environment for your DB labs. By installing the MySQL Installer you can build up your environment and run your first lab there. Some basic operations of MySQL is included in this lab.

> Learn how to build environment for your projects is vital for you students major in CS!!! :laughing:

### Lab2

In this lab numerous SQL sentences are used to make selection, but something awkward is that in the theory course the usage of SQL is not taughtm, so **self-learning** about SQL takes lots of time.

> Thanks to easy-learning SQL, I can eventually finish this lab2 in 2 days.

### Lab3

In this lab further usage of SQL is mentioned. Self-learning once again helped me through it.

### Lab4

In this lab some simple usage of privileges and user account are introduced and used. By referring to some documents you will finish this lab in 5 minutes.

### Lab5

This is a huge lab about *LibraryManagementSystem*, and **JDBC** is mainly used in this lab. You are required to first implement the java codes to implement a library management system, and all previous learnt knowledge about database is used here. After you finish the java codes and pass all the test samples, you can finish the bonus part: frontend.

> WARNING: very time-consuming!!!

### MiniSQL

This is the hazardous biggest project in Sophomore grade, the well-known project ***MINISQL***!!!

The first ever-known biggest project, including constructing a mini SQL application like *MySQL* and so on. Students need to develop this mini database system by constructing from the basic theory, like **buffer management** and **disk management**, then by building **index**, **syntax parser** and so on you can finally make it a successful mini database system.

But a lot of work needs to be done, and several tests are there to be passed.

First you need to understand how a database system works in physical level, then develop it from both physical level and logic level.

Collaborating is first introduced in my CS career.

The project is not added into this repository, see at [minisql](https://github.com/birchtree2/minisql.git)

> The most time-consuming and mental torture!!! :warning:
