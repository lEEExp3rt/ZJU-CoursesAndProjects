## Homework

### hw1

Introduction to databases in this homework.

### hw2

In this homework basic relation algebra are used.

### hw3

Uses of SQL sentences to make selections. Very trivial and time-consuming!!! :angry:

### hw4

Still some SQL usage in this homework. 

### hw5

Write a trigger and a function in SQL.

### hw6

In this homework basic usage of **E-R Diagram** are used. Due to this trivial job, I have to write it by hand, so no file are included in this folder.

### hw7

In this homework you are required to make a lot of exercises about the **Function Dependency**, **Dependency Preserving** and **BCNF**. Very trivial! And the concept of **BCNF**, **3NF** is very complicated in the book. You need to search some references to better handle it.

### hw8

In this homework you are asked for some easy questions about disks and memory about database.

## Labs

### Lab1

First introduced to DBMS. In this course we use *MySQL Server* as the tool. So the first lab is about how to build environment for your DB labs. By installing the MySQL Installer you can build up your environment and run your first lab there. Some basic operations of MySQL is included in this lab.

> Learn how to build environment for your projects is vital for you students major in CS!!! :laughing:

### Lab2

In this lab numerous SQL sentences are used to make selection, but something awkward is that in the theory course the usage of SQL is not taughtm, so **self-learning** about SQL takes lots of time.

> Thanks to easy-learning SQL, I can eventually finish this lab2 in 2 days.

### Lab3

In this lab further usage of SQL is mentioned. Self-learning once again helped me through it.

### Lab4

In this lab some simple usage of privileges and user account are introduced and used. By referring to some documents you will finish this lab in 5 minutes.

### Lab5

This is a huge lab about *LibraryManagementSystem*, and **JDBC** is mainly used in this lab. You are required to first implement the java codes to implement a library management system, and all previous learnt knowledge about database is used here. After you finish the java codes and pass all the test samples, you can finish the bonus part: frontend.

> WARNING: very time-consuming!!!
