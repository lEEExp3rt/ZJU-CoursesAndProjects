## 19.2

**Solution:**

The purpose of the checkpoint mechanism is to prevent long recovery when a system crash happens, so by doing the checkpoint mechanism we can check and commit the already completed transactions to the non-volatile storage and the next time if the system crash happens, these already persistent transactions need not to be redo and undo again.

The frequency of the checkpoint should be appropriate so that when there is abundant transactions in buffer it should be commited.

* When no failure occurs, the checkpoint will make the system works slower a little bit
* When a system crash happens, it will recover from the crash very soon
* When a media(disk) fails, it will take some time to recover from the back-ups.

## 19.10

**Solution:**

Because interactive transactions may include several operations to the same variable in different transactions, so if recovery is done, you need to check all the transactions that update the variable and if some are `abort` while others are `commit`, you need to redo the `commit`s and undo the `abort`s.

The simple way: `operation logging`

## 19.21

**Solution:**

1. Uedo: `T0 B->2000`
2. Redo: `T1 C:700->600`
3. Undo: `T2 A->500`

## 19.23

**Solution:**

```
B: 2000 (undo)
C: 700 (undo)
```

### a

**Solution:**

We dont need to apply any redo because it is not in the dirty page table and its log is already stored in non-volatile storage and can be output correctly.

### b

**Solution:**

`RecLSN` is used to mark the transactions in database recovery system and mark the log's location in logging file of the database.

We can write the `RecLSN` in numeric order so that when database failure happens, it can search and quickly locate the log to apply redos and undos.
