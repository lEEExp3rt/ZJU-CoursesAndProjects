* Course semester: 2024 Spring.

## Homework

### HW1

First introduced to C++ and basic grammer about C++ is taught in the class. Mainly about `string` type, `I/O` format. But how to use them needs practice, so the homework is worthwhile. 

### HW2

This homework is about usage of containers, mainly about `vector`. Very simple.

### HW3

This homework is about basic definition and implementation of `class`. The 4 programming questions are easy to deal with, and help you strengthen your understanding of `class`.

> :warning: `6-4.cpp` is a little trivial

### HW4 && HW5

This homework contains some basic operations about `class`, and very easy work to do.

> :warning: `6-4.cpp` is a little trivial 

### HW6

This homework is very easy, testing some basic operation about `friend`, `reload`, `inline` and `map`, not much work to do.

### HW7

This homework is very easy and you only need to implement a function reloading.

### HW8

This homework is about **inheritance** in C++. After reviewing those knowledge, you will finish it very quick.

### HW9

This homework is about **inheritance** and **polymorphism**. The key point is not easy to understand and you should fully absorb what **polymorphism** and **inheritance** is first, then you can finish this homework very quickly.

> 6-2 is very trivial and it is mainly about **multi-inheritance**.

### HW11

This homework is about **copy constructor**. The content is not difficult, but I think the homework is not very good since it includes knowledge about **operator overloading**.

### HW12

This homework is about **operator overloading**, and very easy to finish it after you fully grasp the knowledge.

### HW13

This homwwork is about **Template** and very easy to finish.

### HW14

This homework is about **Exception** and very easy to finish too.

> 6-1 is very disgusting, you will know it after you do it.

## Labs

### Lab1

The first lab is called *Personal_dairy*, and it is a **multi-files programming lab**, a huge one! 

Some basic usage of `<fstream>` and `<string>` are well used in this project, but most of them are not taught in the class, so you know, **self-learning** once again saved your life from DDL.

After searching for several million times of these, I've finally come to my mind about how to work on it. Though not hard in algorithm aspect, it really tortured me a lot by compiling error, running with wrong answer, not suitting the standard answer from PTA and so on... :cry:

But finally, after thousands of times of developing and debugging, I made it to 100 score. Sense of ACHIEVEMENT right?

### Lab2

This lab is much easier than lab1.

In this lab you are required to implement a database-like program using c++. You will read the information and then calculate some data and output those data in assigned format. By using 3 `map` you can easily accomplish it and there are `map`s that will be embedded into `map`.

### Lab3

In this lab you are required to implement 2 class using basic knowledge of `composition`. Not much work is needed so this is a quick lab.

### Lab4

In this lab you are required to implement 3 basic classes so that a given `main.cpp` can function properly. **Inheritance** and **Polymorphism** is mainly used. The work is not difficult.

> :angry: `inline` will contribute to compile error!!! 

### Lab5

In this lab you are required to implement a `Fraction` class using **operator overloads** and **functions overloads**. It is not difficult to implement.

> In the class you need to use `long long` to store the data rather than `int`, which will result in error.

## Projects

### Project1

In this project, you are required to implement a CLI `ADIF` file parser with given requirements. Mainly using `string` and `class` and `vector` and `map` is enough to finish this project. BUT it is really time-consuming!!! However, it is really a enjoy to do this huge project.
