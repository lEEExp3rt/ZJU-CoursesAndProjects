## Homework

### HW1: Root of AVL tree

This homework contains several operations about the AVL tree. **Balanced tree's rotation** is the most important, and its code can be used in other balanced tree not only for AVL tree but for the Red-Black Tree and so on.

### HW2: Self-printable B+ tree

This homework needs you to **implement a B+ tree** with operations like `initialize`, `insert`(with splitting), `search`. And self-print is needed as the title suggests.

> Very trivial and time-consuming!!! :cry:

### HW3: Document Distance

This homework requires you to calculate the similarity between 2 given files. Each file contains several words, and you add the words by inverted index to calculate their vector of similarity, then you calculate the file similarity from the given equivelent. Not much thinking is needed compared to other algorithm homeworks.

> 1. To simplify the coding task, I made it in C++, which provides me with several convinent libs like `<vector>`, `<map>` and so on, saving a lot time to construct in C
> 2. The tough thing is that in this task you need to make a `stemming` algorithm, so words with different forms should be calculated in the same word.

### HW4: Merge Two Leftist Heaps

This homework only needs you to fill 3 blanks for Leftist Heap implemention. Easy job and take only 1 minute to finish. This help better review the knowledge of the Leftist Heap.

### HW5: BinQueue Find

This homework is more simple than HW4 because once again you only need to fill 2 blanks in the programming exercise. Simple functions of search in a BinQueue is needed.

### HW6

This homework contains 4 selection exercises about **Divide-and-Conquer`, and no other programming exercises.

### HW7

In this home you need to fully grasp **backtracing**, and you need to finish a programming exercise named *Werewolf*.

At first I was scared by this exercise and don't know how to do it. But after thinking about how to construct a search tree and then I can finish coding very quickly. But debugging did consume a lot of time. But worthwhile!
